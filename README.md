# MongoSQL
MongoSQL - BAS (Bridge As Service) - Bridge MongoDB with SQL Service Server (Imitate MySQL server with MongoDB Backend)

## How does it work?
We have a MongoDB server and a client that works with MySQL-type databases.
Mongosql simulates the operation of a MySQL server with identical responses to queries with support for SQL commands, but it already works directly with the MongoDB Database.

### Simply put:
Mongosql is a bridge between MongoDB and the MySQL client

## What is implemented?
Right now - NOTHING!
